<p>I'm starting a programming journey with a new language I am developing called ROOK. In this post, I'll share my motivations for creating it and the goals I aim to achieve with this endeavor.</p>
<h2>Goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern Approach:</strong> I'm crafting a language that embraces modern ergonomics and practices, shedding any legacy baggage. It's about moving forward, not being tethered to the past.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Focus:</strong> ROOK targets <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a> and <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WASI</a>, aiming for seamless cross-platform functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> The language is designed to be expressive and transparent. I believe in showing, not hiding - the user should see and understand everything clearly.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Syntax / Features:</strong> ROOK follows a &quot;one way&quot; approach to syntax. Hence the name - <strong>R</strong>eally <strong>O</strong>nly <strong>O</strong>ne <strong>K</strong>eyword. This isn't about overwhelming options; it's about streamlined, clear-cut coding. I'm focusing on fewer features, but each will be robust and powerful. It's about quality, not quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Programming:</strong> The language encourages a proactive approach to writing secure and reliable code.</li>
<li><strong>Learning from the Best:</strong> Inspiration is drawn from languages like <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BSVino/JaiPrimer/blob/master/JaiPrimer.md">Jai</a>, and <a href="https://harelang.org/">Hare</a> - all pioneers in modern language design.</li>
<li><strong>Robust Developer Tools:</strong> I'm integrating essential tools like LSP, built-in formatter, in-language compilation scripts (a nod to Zig), and integrated testing and examples. It's all about making the developer's life easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non-Goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li>This isn't about replacing C/C++. It's about offering something different.</li>
<li>Stepping away from C-like syntax to explore new frontiers.</li>
<li>ROOK is not about embracing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</li>
<li>I'm not trying to pack it with endless features. It's about doing more with less.</li>
<li>I'm avoiding complex abstractions and convoluted build systems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal Goals:</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a personal challenge. I'm rethinking how I program and exploring my ideal syntax.</li>
<li>Delving into compilers and language design, an area I deeply cherish, harks back to an unforgettable university class. The professor's expertise truly ignited my passion, and the crowning achievement was developing a working compiler by the end of the course, an experience I found profoundly rewarding.</li>
<li>Ironically, through this journey, I'm sharpening my skills in C(99) and low-level programming.</li>
</ul>
<p>With ROOK, I'm not just creating a language. I'm building a tool that aligns with how I believe programming should be: straightforward, effective, and pragmatic. It's a reflection of my programming philosophy, and I'm excited to share this journey with you.</p>
